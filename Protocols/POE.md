**Power over Ethernet**, or **PoE**, describes any of several [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard "Technical standard") or [ad hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc "Ad hoc") systems that pass [electric power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power "Electric power") along with data on [twisted-pair Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair "Ethernet over twisted pair") cabling. This allows a single cable to provide both a data connection and enough electricity to power devices such as [wireless access points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point "Wireless access point") (WAPs), [Internet Protocol (IP) cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_camera "IP camera") and [voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP_phone "VoIP phone").
