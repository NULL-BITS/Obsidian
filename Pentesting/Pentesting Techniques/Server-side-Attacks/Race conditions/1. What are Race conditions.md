# Race conditions

Race conditions are a common type of vulnerability closely related to business [logic flaws](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws). They occur when websites process requests concurrently without adequate safeguards. This can lead to multiple distinct threads interacting with the same data at the same time, resulting in a "collision" that causes unintended behavior in the application. A race condition attack uses carefully timed requests to cause intentional collisions and exploit this unintended behavior for malicious purposes.

The period of time during which a collision is possible is known as the "race window". This could be the fraction of a second between two interactions with the database, for example.

Like other logic flaws, the impact of a race condition is heavily dependent on the application and the specific functionality in which it occurs.

In this section, you'll learn how to identify and exploit different types of race condition. We'll teach you how Burp Suite's built-in tooling can help you to overcome the challenges of performing classic attacks, plus a tried and tested methodology that enables you to detect novel classes of race condition in hidden multi-step processes. These go far beyond the limit overruns that you may be familiar with already.

#### PortSwigger Research

As usual, we've also provided a number of deliberately vulnerable labs that you can use to practice what you've learned safely against realistic targets. Many of these are based on original PortSwigger research, first presented at Black Hat USA 2023.
