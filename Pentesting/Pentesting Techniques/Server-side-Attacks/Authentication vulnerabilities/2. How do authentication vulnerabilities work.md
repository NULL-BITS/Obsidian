## How do authentication vulnerabilities arise?

Broadly speaking, most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms arise in one of two ways:

- The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes referred to as "broken authentication".

In many areas of web development, [logic flaws](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws) will simply cause the website to behave unexpectedly, which may or may not be a security issue. However, as authentication is so critical to security, the likelihood that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to security issues is clearly elevated.

## What is the impact of vulnerable authentication?

The impact of authentication vulnerabilities can be very severe. Once an attacker has either bypassed authentication or has brute-forced their way into another user's account, they have access to all the data and functionality that the compromised account has. If they are able to compromise a high-privileged account, such as a system administrator, they could take full control over the entire application and potentially gain access to internal infrastructure.

Even compromising a low-privileged account might still grant an attacker access to data that they otherwise shouldn't have, such as commercially sensitive business information. Even if the account does not have access to any sensitive data, it might still allow the attacker to access additional pages, which provide a further attack surface. Often, certain high-severity attacks will not be possible from publicly accessible pages, but they may be possible from an internal page.

## Vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms

A website's authentication system usually consists of several distinct mechanisms where vulnerabilities may occur. Some vulnerabilities are broadly applicable across all of these contexts, whereas others are more specific to the functionality provided.

We will look more closely at some of the most common vulnerabilities in the following areas:

- [Vulnerabilities in password-based login](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based) LABS
- [Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor) LABS
- [Vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/other-mechanisms) LABS

Note that several of the labs require you to enumerate usernames and brute-force passwords. To help you with this process, we've provided a shortlist of candidate [usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames) and [passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords) that you should use to solve the labs.
