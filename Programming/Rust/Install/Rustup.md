## Notes about Rust installation



### Getting started

If you're just getting started with Rust and would like a more detailed walk-through, see our [getting started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) page.

### Toolchain management with #rustup

Rust is installed and managed by the [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/) tool. Rust has a 6-week [rapid release process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0507-release-channels.md) and supports a [great number of platforms](https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html), so there are many builds of Rust available at any time. `rustup` manages these builds in a consistent way on every platform that Rust supports, enabling installation of Rust from the beta and nightly release channels as well as support for additional cross-compilation targets.

If you've installed `rustup` in the past, you can update your installation by running `rustup update`.

For more information see the [`rustup` documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/).

### Configuring the `PATH` environment variable

In the Rust development environment, all tools are installed to the `~/.cargo/bin` directory, and this is where you will find the Rust toolchain, including `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rustup`.

Accordingly, it is customary for Rust developers to include this directory in their [`PATH` environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). During installation `rustup` will attempt to configure the `PATH`. Because of differences between platforms, command shells, and bugs in `rustup`, the modifications to `PATH` may not take effect until the console is restarted, or the user is logged out, or it may not succeed at all.

If, after installation, running `rustc --version` in the console fails, this is the most likely reason.

### Uninstall Rust

If at any point you would like to uninstall Rust, you can run `rustup self uninstall`. We'll miss you though!
