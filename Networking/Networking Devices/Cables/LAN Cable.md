## What Are The Cables Used for?

LAN cables are used for connecting the devices in a [[3. LAN]] with each other. There are various cables that be used. This includes:

- Copper Twisted Pair (Also referred to as LAN, Ethernet or Networking cable)
- [Coaxial Cable](https://infinity-cable-products.com/collections/coaxial "coaxial cable")
- [Fiber Cable](https://infinity-cable-products.com/collections/fiber-optic "fiber cable")

Each of these cables have different designs and functions which power an ethernet connection. To touch on these briefly you'll mostly be using coax cable for connection from your ISP to your modem. This type of cable helps power that connection which gives your network internet access. Coax cables are usually designed with shielding inside them to perform in areas with EMI and higher frequencies.

Twisted pair copper cable is your most common cables used to connect your computers, routers, switches, printers, gaming systems, PoE devices, IP cameras and much more. They come in many different categories such as:

- Cat5e Cable
- Cat6 Cable
- Cat6A Cable
- Cat8 Cable

Note here that each of these cables have a different performance rating. These cables are often used to connect speeds up to gigabit ethernet and beyond. LAN cables also come in unshielded and shielded versions. Shielded LAN cables are for areas with EMI (Electromagnetic Interference). This is common in doctors offices, around cell towers and heavy machinery and will provide better signal quality because of the foil in these areas. Unshielded LAN cables are going to be installed in your homes and business when no EMI is present. Shielded cables are often more expensive than unshielded cables because of the extra material used and different manufacturing methods. Copper twisted pair cable come in different types as well. You will see them in patch cables, crossover cables, and bulk lengths. They will be comprised of a rj45 connector on one end and will be able to plug is to an ethernet port of your choice.

Fiber cable (fiber optic cable) is a type of cable which is made of optical fibers to carry light. This cable can carry signals over long distances and is another very popular solution for business use. Some of the common fiber cable types are:

- OFC - Optical Fiber Conductive
- OFN - Optical fiber nonconductive
- OFCG - Optical fiber conductive general use
- OFNG - Optical fiber nonconductive general use
- OFCP - Optical fiber conductive plenum
- OFNO - Optical fiber nonconductive plenum
- OFCR - Optical fiber conductive riser
- OFNR - Optical fiber nonconductive riser
- OPGW - Optical fiber composite overhead ground wire
- ADSS - All-Dielectric Self-Supporting
- OSP - Fiber optic cable outside plant
- MDU - Fiber optics cable multiple dwelling unit

Fiber cables are also commonly found with different connector types. Some of these range from:

- SC to LC
- SC to SC
- ST to LC
- ST to SC
- LC to LC
