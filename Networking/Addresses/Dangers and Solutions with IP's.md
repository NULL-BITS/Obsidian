## IP address security threats

Cybercriminals can use various techniques to obtain your IP address. Two of the most common are social engineering and online stalking.

Attackers can use social engineering to deceive you into revealing your IP address. For example, they can find you through Skype or a similar instant messaging application, which uses IP addresses to communicate. If you chat with strangers using these apps, it is important to note that they can see your IP address. Attackers can use a Skype Resolver tool, where they can find your IP address from your username.


### Online stalking

Criminals can track down your IP address by merely stalking your online activity. Any number of online activities can reveal your IP address, from playing video games to commenting on websites and forums.

Once they have your IP address, attackers can go to an IP address tracking website, such as whatismyipaddress.com, type it in, and then get an idea of your location. They can then cross-reference other open-source data if they want to validate whether the IP address is associated with you specifically. They can then use LinkedIn, Facebook, or other social networks that show where you live, and then see if that matches the area given.

If a Facebook stalker uses a [phishing](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/phishing-prevention-tips) attack against people with your name to install spying [malware](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/malware-protection), the IP address associated with your system would likely confirm your identity to the stalker.

If cybercriminals know your IP address, they can launch attacks against you or even impersonate you. It is important to be aware of the risks and how to mitigate them. Risks include:

### Downloading illegal content using your IP address

Hackers are known to use hacked IP addresses to download illegal content and anything else they do not want to be traced back to them. For example, using the identity of your IP address, criminals could download pirated movies, music, and video – which would breach your ISP’s terms of use – and much more seriously, content related to terrorism or child pornography. This could mean that you – through no fault of your own – could attract the attention of law enforcement.

### Tracking down your location

If they know your IP address, hackers can use geolocation technology to identify your region, city, and state. They only need to do a little more digging on social media to identify your home and potentially burgle it when they know you are away.

### Directly attacking your network

Criminals can directly target your network and launch a variety of assaults. One of the most popular is a [DDoS attack](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/ddos-attacks) (distributed denial-of-service). This type of cyberattack occurs when hackers use previously infected machines to generate a high volume of requests to flood the targeted system or server. This creates too much traffic for the server to handle, resulting in a disruption of services. Essentially, it shuts down your internet. While this attack is typically launched against businesses and video game services, it can occur against an individual, though this is much less common. Online gamers are at particularly high risk for this, as their screen is visible while streaming (on which an IP address can be discovered).

### Hacking into your device

The internet uses ports as well as your IP address to connect. There are thousands of ports for every IP address, and a hacker who knows your IP can try those ports to attempt to force a connection. For example, they could take over your phone and steal your information. If a criminal does obtain access to your device, they could install malware on it.

## How to protect and hide your IP address

Hiding your IP address is a way to protect your personal information and online identity. The two primary ways to hide your IP address are:

1. Using a proxy server
2. [Using a virtual private network (VPN)](https://www.kaspersky.com/vpn-secure-connection)

A proxy server is an intermediary server through which your traffic is routed:

- The internet servers you visit see only the IP address of that proxy server and not your IP address.
- When those servers send information back to you, it goes to the proxy server, which then routes it to you.

A drawback of proxy servers is that some of the services can spy on you — so you need to trust it. Depending on which one you use, they can also insert ads into your browser.

VPN offers a better solution:

- When you connect your computer – or smartphone or tablet – to a VPN, the device acts as if it is on the same local network as the VPN.
- All your network traffic is sent over a secure connection to the VPN.
- Because your computer behaves as if it is on the network, you can securely access local network resources even when you are in another country.
- You can also use the internet as if you were present at the VPN’s location, which has benefits if you are using public Wi-Fi or want to access geo-blocked websites.

[Kaspersky Secure Connection](https://www.kaspersky.com/vpn-connection) is a VPN that protects you on public Wi-Fi, keeps your communications private, and ensures that you are not exposed to phishing, malware, viruses, and other cyber threats.

## When should you use VPN

Using a VPN hides your IP address and redirects your traffic through a separate server, making it much safer for you online. Situations where you might use a VPN include:

### When using public Wi-Fi

When using a [public Wi-Fi network](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/public-wifi), even one that is password-protected, a VPN is advisable. If a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network, it is easy for them to snoop on your data. The basic security that the average public Wi-Fi network employs does not provide robust protection from other users on the same network.

Using a VPN will add an extra layer of security to your data, ensuring you bypass the public Wi-Fi’s ISP and encrypting all your communication.

### When you are traveling

If you are traveling to a foreign country – for example, China, where sites like Facebook are blocked – a VPN can help you access services that may not be available in that country. 

The VPN will often allow you to use streaming services that you paid for and have access to in your home country, but they are not available in another because of international rights issues. Using a VPN can enable you to use the service as if you were at home. Travelers may also be able to find cheaper airfare when using a VPN, as prices can vary from region to region.

### When you are working remotely

This is especially relevant in the post-COVID world, where many [people are working remotely](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/remote-working-how-to-stay-safe). Often employers require the use of a VPN to access company services remotely for security reasons. A VPN that connects to your office's server can give you access to internal company networks and resources when you are not in the office. It can do the same for your home network while you are out and about. 

### When you just want some privacy

Even in the comfort of your own home, using the internet for everyday purposes, using a VPN can be a good idea. Whenever you access a website, the server you connect to logs your IP address and attaches it to all the other data the site can learn about you: your browsing habits, what you click on, how long you spend looking at a particular page. They can sell this data to advertising companies who use it to tailor ads straight to you. This is why ads on the internet sometimes feel oddly personal: it’s because they are. Your IP address can also be used to track your location, even when your location services are turned off. Using a VPN prevents you from leaving footprints on the web.

Don’t forget your mobile devices, either. They have IP addresses too, and you probably use them in a wider variety of locations than your home computer, including public Wi-Fi hotspots. [It is advisable to use a VPN on your mobile](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/why-use-vpn-on-smartphone) when connecting to a network you may not fully trust.

## Other ways to protect your privacy

### [Change privacy settings on instant messaging applications](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA339/how-do-i-change-my-skype-settings)

Apps installed on your device are a major source of IP address hacking. Instant messaging and other calling apps can be used as a tool by cybercriminals. Using IM apps only allows direct connections from contacts and doesn't accept calls or messages from people you don’t know. Changing your privacy settings makes it harder to find your IP address because people who don’t know you cannot connect with you.

### Create unique passwords

Your device password is the only barrier that can restrict people from accessing your device. Some people prefer to stick to their devices' default passwords, which makes them vulnerable to attack. Like all your accounts, your device needs to have a unique and strong password that is not easy to decode. A strong password contains a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numerals, and characters. This will help to safeguard your device against IP address hacking.

### Stay alert to phishing emails and malicious content

A high proportion of malware and device tracking software is installed via phishing emails. When you connect with any site, this provides the site with access to your IP address and device location, making it vulnerable to hacking. Be vigilant when opening emails from unknown senders and avoid clicking on links that could send you to unauthorized sites. Pay close attention to the emails' content, even if they appear to come from well-known sites and legitimate businesses.

### Use a good antivirus solution and keep it up to date

Install comprehensive antivirus software and keep it up to date. For example, [Kaspersky’s Anti-Virus protection](https://www.kaspersky.com/free-antivirus) guards you from viruses on your PC and Android devices, secures and stores your passwords and private documents, and encrypts the data you send and receive online with VPN.

Protecting your IP address is a crucial aspect of protecting your online identity. Securing it through these steps is a way to stay safe against the wide variety of cybercriminals' attacks.
