## Class C Public & Private IP Address Range

Class C addresses are used in small local area networks (LANs). Class C allows for approximately 2 million networks by using the first three octets for the network ID. In a class C IP address, the first three bits of the first octet are always 1 1 0. And the remaining 21 bits of first three octets complete the network ID. The last octet (8 bits) represent the host ID and allows for 254 hosts per network. Class C network number values begins at 192 and end at 223.

- Public IP Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
    - First octet value range from 192 to 223
- Private IP Range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (See [[private IP addresses]] for more information)
- Special IP Range: 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 (See [[Special IP Addresses]] for more information)
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (24 bits)
- Number of Networks: 2,097,150
- Number of Hosts per Network: 254
